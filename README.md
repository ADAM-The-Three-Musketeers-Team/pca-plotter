## Style

ALl styles can be found in the [css](src/css) folder.

[shadow-style.css](src/css/shadow-style.css) is used to style the elements inside Shadow DOM. A Shadow DOM is hidden so you can not access it directly.

[style.css](src/css/style.css) is just a normal CSS file used for styling the page. The only difference is that It is imported inside [main.js](src/main.js) file.
